## Gather evidence on requirements for reproducible DES

* **Empirical research** - Barriers and facilitators identified from reproducing eight published healthcare DES models (Python/R).

## Gather evidence on requirements for reproducible DES

* **Empirical research** - Barriers and facilitators identified from reproducing eight published healthcare DES models (Python/R).
* **NHS RAP guidelines** - Established framework for developing reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) in the NHS.

## Gather evidence on requirements for reproducible DES

* **Empirical research** - Barriers and facilitators identified from reproducing eight published healthcare DES models (Python/R).
* **NHS RAP guidelines** - Established framework for developing reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) in the NHS.

These serve different purposes. Distinction between **reproducibility** and a RAP:

## Gather evidence on requirements for reproducible DES

* **Empirical research** - Barriers and facilitators identified from reproducing eight published healthcare DES models (Python/R).
* **NHS RAP guidelines** - Established framework for developing reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) in the NHS.
* **Established DES modeling practices** - All the necessary stages of creation of a DES model were identified from domain expertise and textbook recommendations.
    * **Why?** The RAP should include all the analysis stages of a typical DES modelling process.

## From theory to practice: building working examples

Developed simple M/M/s examples in Python and R that meet all requirements we identified.

## Testing with a real-world stroke model

Applied out templates to a stroke pathway model described in a published paper. This provided a **real**, more **complex** example and helped **refine** the template.

## Knowledge mobilisation: online book

The M/M/s and stroke models demonstrate what reproducible DES looks like, they don't show modellers *how* to get there.

I am developing an online book which breaks down these models, showing how they met each requirement. The book:

* Provides **actionable steps** which guide modellers to create a model which meets all the reproducibility and RAP requirements.
* Allows people to easily choose particular pages of interest (e.g. already have a model, but want to find out more about citation).

## Looking forwards

<br>

**Review:** At a good stage for review of some of these materials.

* Tom has reviewed the M/M/s models.
* Alison - review of R (mentioning before - timing better now?)
* Nav - review of book, if happy to?
* Andy & Chris - at a later stage?

<br>

**Plan:** Continuing to work on these materials. Will describe in a publication.
