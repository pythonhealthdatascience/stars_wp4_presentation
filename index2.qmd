## Gather evidence on requirements for reproducible DES

* **Empirical research** - Barriers and facilitators identified from reproducing eight published healthcare DES models (Python/R).
* **NHS RAP guidelines** - Established framework for developing reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) in the NHS.

These serve different purposes. Distinction between **reproducibility** and a RAP:

## Gather evidence on requirements for reproducible DES

* **Empirical research** - Barriers and facilitators identified from reproducing eight published healthcare DES models (Python/R).
* **NHS RAP guidelines** - Established framework for developing reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) in the NHS.
* **Established DES modeling practices** - All the necessary stages of creation of a DES model were identified from domain expertise and textbook recommendations.
    * **Why?** The RAP should include all the analysis stages of a typical DES modelling process.

## From theory to practice: building working examples

Developed simple M/M/s examples in Python and R that meet all requirements we identified.

## Testing with a real-world stroke model

Applied out templates to a stroke pathway model described in a published paper. This was important for:

* Testing on a more complex example.
* Refining the template.
* Providing a practical demonstration.

## Knowledge mobilisation: online book

For modellers trying to develop reproducible DES, the M/M/s and stroke models are valuable in providing fully formed examples. However, these were developed iteratively, and so it is important to support modellers in how they could work step-by-step to build these models on their own. Therefore, created an online book which explains the requirements and walks through how to implement them. This is helpful for:

* Step-by-step building models iterativey developing reproducibility practices alongside modelling skills
* Easier to dip in for people looking for guidance on specific requirements
